Supplementary material for the article "The impact of data pre-processing techniques on intrusion detection models".

Below, the subtitles of the files referring to the complementary materials on the results of the experiments and evaluation tests are presented.The materials contain graphs showing the data's normality distributions that justify the use of non-parametric statistical tests in the investigation. In addition to tables with differences in critical distances between all data pre-processing techniques, carried out in comparing performance with the Nemenyi test, among others.

The figure (1_fig_non-normal_distribution_techniques.jpg) shows the non-normal distribution of the sample data for the data preprocessing techniques. The non-normal distribution justifies the execution of non-parametric statistical tests in the investigation. Non-parametric tests are applied when there is no normal distribution between sample data.

The figure (2_fig_non-normal_distribution_algorithms.jpg) shows the non-normal distribution of the sample data concerning the classification algorithms.

The file (3_appendices_comparisons_techniques_nemenyi_test.pdf) shows in detail the comparisons between the groups of data preprocessing techniques in the binary class models, multiclass models for specific attacks of Group 1, containing Reconnaissance attacks (UNSW-NB15) and attacks PortScan (CIC-IDS2017), and multiclass models for specific Group 2 attacks, containing DoS attacks (UNSW-NB15) and DoS/DDoS attacks (CIC-IDS2017).
